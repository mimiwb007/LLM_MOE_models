Deep learning models today are built on artificial neural networks, which consist of layers of interconnected units known as "neurons" or nodes. Each neuron processes incoming data, performs a basic mathematical operation (an activation function), and passes the result to the next layer. More sophisticated models, such as transformers, incorporate advanced mechanisms like self-attention, enabling them to identify intricate patterns within data.

On the other hand, traditional **dense models**, which process every part of the network for each input, can be computationally expensive. To address this, **Mixture of Experts (MoE) models** introduce a more efficient approach by utilizing a ***sparse architecture***, activating only the most relevant sections of the network—referred to as "experts"—for each individual input. This strategy allows MoE models to perform complex tasks, such as natural language processing, while consuming significantly less computational power.

In a group project, it's common for the team to consist of smaller subgroups, each excelling in a particular task. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) model functions in a similar manner. It breaks down a complex problem into smaller, specialized components, known as "experts," with each expert focusing on solving a specific aspect of the overall challenge.

Following are the key advantages of MoE Models:

- **Pretraining is significantly quicker** than with dense models.
- **Inference speed is faster, even with an equivalent number of parameters.**
- **Demand high VRAM since all experts must be stored** in memory simultaneously.

A Mixture of Experts (MoE) model consists of two key components: Experts, which are specialized smaller neural networks focused on specific tasks, and a Router, which selectively activates the relevant experts based on the input data. This selective activation enhances efficiency by using only the necessary experts for each task.

### Main Components of MOE

In a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, there are two important parts that make it work:

1. **Experts** - Think of experts as special workers in a factory. Each worker is really good at one specific task. In the case of an MoE model, these ***"experts" are actually smaller neural networks (like FFNNs)*** that **focus on specific parts of the problem**. Only a few of these experts are needed to work on each task, depending on what’s required.
2. **Router or Gate Network** - The router is like a ***manager who decides which experts should work on which task***. It looks at the input data (like a piece of text or an image) and decides which experts are the best ones to handle it. Instead of using the whole team for everything, the router only activates the experts that are needed, making the process more efficient.

**Experts**

**Experts that are Mini Neural Networks.** 

In a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, the "experts" are like mini neural networks, each trained to handle different tasks or types of data. 

**Few Active Experts at a Time.** 

1. However, in MoE models, these specialists don't all work at the same time. The model is designed to be "sparse," which means only a few experts are active at any given moment, depending on the task at hand. 
2. This helps the system stay focused and efficient, using just the right specialists for the job, rather than overloading it with too many tasks or experts working unnecessarily. This approach keeps the model from being overwhelmed and makes it faster and more efficient.

**Router or Gate Network**

In a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, the "gating network" helps the model decide which experts (mini neural networks) should handle a specific task. Think of it like a smart guide that looks at the input (like a sentence to be translated) and chooses the best experts to work on it.

There are different ways the gating network can choose the experts, which we call "routing algorithms." Here are a few simple ones:

1. **Top-k routing:** The gating network picks the top 'k' experts with the highest scores to handle the task.
2. **Expert choice routing:** Instead of the data picking the experts, the experts decide which tasks they're best suited for. This helps keep everything balanced.
