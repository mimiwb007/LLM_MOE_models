Deep learning models today are built on artificial neural networks, which consist of layers of interconnected units known as "neurons" or nodes. Each neuron processes incoming data, performs a basic mathematical operation (an activation function), and passes the result to the next layer. More sophisticated models, such as transformers, incorporate advanced mechanisms like self-attention, enabling them to identify intricate patterns within data.

On the other hand, traditional **dense models**, which process every part of the network for each input, can be computationally expensive. To address this, **Mixture of Experts (MoE) models** introduce a more efficient approach by utilizing a ***sparse architecture***, activating only the most relevant sections of the network—referred to as "experts"—for each individual input. This strategy allows MoE models to perform complex tasks, such as natural language processing, while consuming significantly less computational power.

In a group project, it's common for the team to consist of smaller subgroups, each excelling in a particular task. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) model functions in a similar manner. It breaks down a complex problem into smaller, specialized components, known as "experts," with each expert focusing on solving a specific aspect of the overall challenge.

Following are the key advantages of MoE Models:

- **Pretraining is significantly quicker** than with dense models.
- **Inference speed is faster, even with an equivalent number of parameters.**
- **Demand high VRAM since all experts must be stored** in memory simultaneously.

A Mixture of Experts (MoE) model consists of two key components: Experts, which are specialized smaller neural networks focused on specific tasks, and a Router, which selectively activates the relevant experts based on the input data. This selective activation enhances efficiency by using only the necessary experts for each task.
